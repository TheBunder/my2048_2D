# my2048_2D - A 2D Array Game

This repository contains my2048_2D, a game developed as a personal project during my tenth grade.  While the class assignment focused on one-dimensional arrays, I took the initiative to learn and implement multi-dimensional arrays to create a more polished and engaging game experience.  I also dedicated time to designing appealing ASCII art for the game's visuals.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates my proactive approach to learning beyond the curriculum.  Driven by a desire to create a more complete and visually appealing game, I independently studied multi-dimensional arrays and ASCII art techniques.  This project showcases my ability to learn new concepts and apply them creatively to achieve a desired outcome.

## How to Play

To play my2048_2D, simply download the executable file (`my2048_2D.exe`) from this repository and run it.  No further setup or installation is required.

## Development Notes

This project was a personal exploration of data structures and visual design in programming.  It was a rewarding experience to learn and apply these concepts to create a functional and visually appealing game.
